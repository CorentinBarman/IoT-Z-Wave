## Intro

After installing the packages we can check the functionality by launching the server on the pi and connecting to the following links (function that are already implemented):

    http://192.168.1.2:5000/sensors/<node_id>/get_temperature

While testing we tried the sensors 1, 4 and 5 (indicated when launching the server). The sensor **4** was the only functional.


## Development

The lab doc states a list of functions to implement these are found in ``./Lab2-ZWAVE.pdf`` page 8.

## Encountered issues

* API doc : ``get_nodes_list`` missing "[]"
* API doc : ``get_luminance`` says *humidity* ğŸ˜
